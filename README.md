# UPSERS

Utilizing my experience working in a UPS hub I addressed two common pain points that form the basis of the MVP for this app:  

1.Signing up for aditional shifts required utilizing one of two computers in the building.  
2.Calling out for work requires calilng into a number and either talking to a supervisor or leaving a voicemail.

Future features that are envisioned are posting of weekly schedules, push notifications if the schedule changes, push notifications sent to employees if additional employees are needed, ability to view timecards and paystubs, messaging between hub employees/supervisors.
